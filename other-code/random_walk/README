This is code written for the random walk problem in the book, for
CS-791O Fall '97.  

To compile you must have GNU make type 

make

(sometime gmake) on UMASS-CS machines.

To use this program for a 19-state 15-step random walk task with
on-line updating and alphas 0,0.01,0.02,....1.0 type

walk on 0 1.0 0.01 15

Or just type 

walk

to get command line requirements.

The Makefile contains a rule which will generate the graphs seen in
the book.  Type 

make test

for both on-line and off-line postscript plots

Note: This was written as a HW assignment and the code was not
intended for eyes other than mine, but it's pretty straightforward and
sparsley commented.  I hope it helps, if you need help getting this
running contact me and I'll see what I can do.
